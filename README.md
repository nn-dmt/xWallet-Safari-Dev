TEST BUILD x-WALLET for SAFARI

CONVERTED DIRECTLY FROM CHROME PLUGIN USING XCODE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Official wallet website: https://xwallet.kaddex.com
Official chrome plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/x-wallet/bofddndhbegljegmpmnlbhcejofmjgbn


TO BUILD:

Open xcode project, make sure macOS is selected and not iOS - click build.

This should build the extension and load it into Safari, but it will not show until you enable developer options.

Open Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop in the Menu Bar

and then:

Develop Menu > Allow Unsigned Extentions

Now Safari > Preferences > Extensions will show the x-Wallet extension.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL APP DEVELOPER
